## Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase

I'll have to load some stuff that I had on the previous quarto document. I don't need to reinstall anything since I actually submitted all of this in last week's document. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```


# Q10

msa is the package found on bioconductor and not CRAN

# Q11

# Q12

devtools can be used to install packages from github and bitbucket. 
```{r}
aa<-get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

# Q13

214 amino acids. 

```{r}
#blast<-blast.pdb(aa)
#hits<-plot(blast)

```
Great idea you're hitting me with in class. Saving results so that we don't have to re-blast! Wouldn't that have been great last week.

```{r}
save(hits,blast,file="blast_results.Rds")
```

```{r}
#hit em with the top hits
#head(hits$pdb.id)
```
Now we're going to download related PDB files. I don't understand this code. That's probably my fault. 
```{r}
files<-get.pdb(hits$pdb.id,path="pdbs",split=TRUE,gzip=TRUE)
```

Now we can align and superimpose structures. `pdbaln()` is how we align.

```{r}
pdbalign<-pdbaln(files,fit=TRUE,exefile="msa")
```

Now I'm going to make a vector containing PDB codes for figure axes and then draw a schematic alignment.

```{r}
ids<-basename.pdb(pdbalign$id)
#plot(pdbalign,labels=ids, dev='png')
```

![](000021.png)

My plot doesn't have the sequence alignment overview? 
>>>>>>me from the future couldn't render because of this plot so I asked Claude and Claude told me to set `dev='png'` or any other raster format which worked beautifully and fixed my plot
And apparently my plot will NOT render because the "figure margins are too large" no matter what I try or what I ask Claude to do or even asking a coding friend what to do. I inserted the png so you know I did it, and then I made the plot code a comment so that I can actually render this whole thing. 
Now apparently I can annotate

```{r}
anno<-pdb.annotate(ids)
unique(anno$source)
anno
```

Alright, time to start performing PCA.

```{r}
pc.xray<-pca(pdbalign)
plot(pc.xray)
```
Next we're going to calculate RMSD.

```{r}
rd<-rmsd(pdbalign)

#structure-based clustering??
hc.rd<-hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd<-cutree(hc.rd,k=3)

plot(pc.xray,1:2,col="darkcyan",bg=grps.rd,pch=21,cex=1)
```
## Optional further visualization

We can VISUALIZE the principal components!

```{r}
pc1<- mktrj(pc.xray,pc=1,file="pc_1.pdb")
```

CRAZY.

we can also plot this in ggplot and with ggrepel.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

df<-data.frame(PC1=pc.xray$z[,1],
               PC2=pc.xray$z[,2],
               col=as.factor(grps.rd),
               ids=ids)

p<-ggplot(df)+
  aes(PC1,PC2,col=col,label=ids)+
  geom_point(size=1)+
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps=20)+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  scale_color_manual(values=c("darkcyan","pink","violet"))

p
```

## Normal Mode Analysis

```{r}
modes<-nma(pdbalign)
plot(modes,pdbalign,col=grps.rd)
```

# Q14 

A lot of the upper lines are almost like an amplified version of the black lines. I think it indicates areas that are not as conserved and are able to have fluctuations without impacting main function as majorly.
